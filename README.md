## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a predictive model that can estimate an individual's medical insurance cost based on their personal information. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a regression model that predicts the insurance cost as accurately as possible.

Key steps include:
- Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, categorical encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualizing relationships between features and costs)
- Building Regression Models
- Evaluating Model Performance
